We need to know that it it is not outside of the facility - if it is that is a very serious problem for the company.\r\n\r\nBy fox do you literally mean the red furry animal? That seems very unlikely, your claim is that a fox broke through our security at the base? Surely that means you are not doing your job properly? Does this mean people can just stroll into your facility?\r\n\r\nSince your location has very patchy access to global internet services and the Arque Global VPN, it is not possible to de-activate active badges remotely.\r\n\r\nTell me, where do you believe your badge to be?\r\n\r\nYours,\r\n\r\nHugo Webber\r\nSenior Arque Global Facilities Security Support Specialist"
